# Business Email Compromise (BEC) Detection System

## Objective

This project focuses on building a robust BEC detection system using machine learning techniques. The system aims to analyze email communications within organizations to identify potential BEC threats and prevent unauthorized financial transactions or data disclosures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of email communications collected from various organizations. It includes both benign and malicious samples of emails, with labels indicating whether an email is part of a BEC attack or not.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset into the analysis environment and preprocess the data to prepare it for feature extraction and model training.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the email data, including text analysis of email bodies, header analysis, hyperlink analysis, inline image analysis, and attachment analysis.

3. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to detect BEC attacks based on the extracted features. Explore various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, or neural networks to determine the most effective approach.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Ensure that the models can effectively differentiate between benign and malicious emails.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Identify patterns and insights from the analysis to enhance the BEC detection system further. Provide recommendations for improving email security and preventing BEC attacks based on the findings.

## File Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- **README.md**: This readme file providing an overview of the project.
- **dataset/**: Directory containing the dataset files.
- **colab/**: Jupyter notebooks used for data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and evaluation.
